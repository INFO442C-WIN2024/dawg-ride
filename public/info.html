                <h2>NightRide Shuttle</h2>
            <h3>How it Works</h3>
            <p>NightRide shuttles pick up passengers at one of eight scheduled stops around campus. After the Flagpole
                stop, the last scheduled stop on campus, shuttles deviate from the fixed route to drop off riders at
                their requested location within the East or West zone boundaries. To be dropped off in the East zone,
                riders need to be on an East zone shuttle. Similarly, to be dropped off in the West zone, riders need to
                be on a West zone shuttle. Riders can transfer from a West zone shuttle to an East zone shuttle or vice
                versa at the Flagpole stop. Review the Frequently asked questions for more information.</p>

            <h3>When it operates</h3>
            <p>Shuttles pick up passengers from 8 p.m. until 1:34 a.m. for the East zone and from 8 p.m. until 1:39 a.m.
                for the West zone, Monday through Friday (excluding University holidays) during the Autumn, Winter and
                Spring quarters with extended service running until 3:30 a.m. the week before and the week of finals.
                Pick
                up time schedules for both zones are listed below.
            </p>

            <h3>Things to Note</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Because the service allows for deviations, it may run behind schedule periodically.</li>
                <li>Please do not ask the driver to access an area that is challenging to navigate.</li>
            </ul>

            <button class="accordion">How do I identify the shuttle?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>NightRide shuttles are white and purple ADA accessible shuttle buses with “Transportation Services”
                    written on one side and a Dubs image displayed on the other. An SP+ vendor logo is also visible
                    above the front doors.

            <button class="accordion">Where do I board the shuttle?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Except for the IMA and UW Tower stops, all stops share a King County Metro bus stop, (five of those
                    stops are along Stevens Way), and are designated as NightRide stops by a decal posted on the bus
                    schedule kiosk. The IMA and the UW Tower stops have full signage.
                </p>

                    width="200">
                <img src="./img/nightride-sign2.jpg"
                    alt="NightRide shares the King County Metro bus stop at the HUB (stop number 25). " width="200">
                <p>Drivers open the shuttle doors at each stop and scan the area for potential riders before proceeding
                    to the next stop.
                    For stop descriptions, check out the route schedules for the East zone and West zone. You can also
                    view the Zone map for a visual of the stop locations.
                </p>

            </div>

            <button class="accordion">What if I want to be dropped off at a location not on the list of scheduled
                stops?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>This is called a deviation, a rider’s requested drop off location within the zone boundaries (but not
                    along the scheduled route). The service will only drop off at scheduled stops while traveling along
                    the scheduled stops route. However, riders may remain on the bus and request a deviation at the
                    Flagpole stop, the last scheduled stop on campus (East deviations from an East zone shuttle and West
                    deviations from a West zone shuttle).

                    After the Flagpole stop, East and West zone shuttles continue on to drop off riders in the East and
                    West zones. (See service routes for the East zone and West zone.)</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">What if I want to be dropped off in the East Zone or West Zone?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>If you want to be dropped off at a scheduled stop in the East zone, you need to be on an East zone
                    shuttle. If you want to be dropped off at a scheduled stop in the West zone, you need to be on a
                    West zone shuttle.
                </p>
            </div>


            <button class="accordion">What if I board an East Zone bus but need to get to a West Zone stop?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>You have two options:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Option 1: You could remain on the East zone shuttle and let the driver know you wish to transfer
                        to
                        a West zone shuttle at the Flagpole stop.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Option 2: You could exit at any of the six stops in the East zone, and wait for a West zone bus
                        to
                        arrive, in which case there is no need to transfer to another shuttle at the Flagpole stop
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">What if I boarded a West Zone bus, but need to get an East Zone stop?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>All four NightRide shuttles service the East zone stops. So, if you board a West zone bus, you will
                    get to all East zone stops by staying on board. Depending on where you board, it may mean riding the
                    entire route to get to an East zone stop (for example, if you board at the HUB and want to go to the
                    IMA).
