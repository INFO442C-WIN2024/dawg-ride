                <h2>NightRide Shuttle</h2>
                <h3>How it Works</h3>
                <p>NightRide shuttles pick up passengers at one of eight scheduled stops around campus. After the
                    Flagpole
                    stop, the last scheduled stop on campus, shuttles deviate from the fixed route to drop off riders at
                    their requested location within the East or West zone boundaries. To be dropped off in the East
                    zone,
                    riders need to be on an East zone shuttle. Similarly, to be dropped off in the West zone, riders
                    need to
                    be on a West zone shuttle. Riders can transfer from a West zone shuttle to an East zone shuttle or
                    vice
                    versa at the Flagpole stop. Review the Frequently asked questions for more information.</p>

                <h3>When it operates</h3>
                <p>Shuttles pick up passengers from 8 p.m. until 1:34 a.m. for the East zone and from 8 p.m. until 1:39
                    a.m.
                    for the West zone, Monday through Friday (excluding University holidays) during the Autumn, Winter
                    and
                    Spring quarters with extended service running until 3:30 a.m. the week before and the week of
                    finals.
                    Pick
                    up time schedules for both zones are listed below.
                </p>

                <h3>Things to Note</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Because the service allows for deviations, it may run behind schedule periodically.</li>
                    <li>Please do not ask the driver to access an area that is challenging to navigate.</li>
                </ul>

                    <p>NightRide shuttles are white and purple ADA accessible shuttle buses with “Transportation
                        Services”
                        written on one side and a Dubs image displayed on the other. An SP+ vendor logo is also visible

                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Except for the IMA and UW Tower stops, all stops share a King County Metro bus stop, (five of
                        those
                        stops are along Stevens Way), and are designated as NightRide stops by a decal posted on the bus
                        schedule kiosk. The IMA and the UW Tower stops have full signage.

                    <p>Drivers open the shuttle doors at each stop and scan the area for potential riders before
                        proceeding
                        to the next stop.
                        For stop descriptions, check out the route schedules for the East zone and West zone. You can
                        also
                        view the Zone map for a visual of the stop locations.

                <button class="accordion">What if I want to be dropped off at a location not on the list of scheduled
                    stops?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>This is called a deviation, a rider’s requested drop off location within the zone boundaries (but
                        not
                        along the scheduled route). The service will only drop off at scheduled stops while traveling
                        along
                        the scheduled stops route. However, riders may remain on the bus and request a deviation at the
                        Flagpole stop, the last scheduled stop on campus (East deviations from an East zone shuttle and
                        West
                        deviations from a West zone shuttle).

                        After the Flagpole stop, East and West zone shuttles continue on to drop off riders in the East
                        and
                        West zones. (See service routes for the East zone and West zone.)</p>

                            to

                            to

                        entire route to get to an East zone stop (for example, if you board at the HUB and want to go to
