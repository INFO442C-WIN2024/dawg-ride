# DawgRide
DawgRide is a mobile app that helps members of the UW community plan their commutes better. Building on the Husky NightRide and SafeTrip services, DawgRide will provide users with real-time updates allowing users to accurately track shuttles and SafeTrip officers live using our interactive map feature. From tracking shuttles to reporting unsafe areas, DawgRide helps UW students feel safe and confident while staying on campus late at night. Our FAQ section educates users on NightRide and SafeTrip services, schedules, and usage. Finally, our interface has a built-in feedback system that allows users to provide input for future improvements.
